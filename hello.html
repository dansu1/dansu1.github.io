<h1>Test terrorist.</h1>
<p>ISIS has been designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and many individual countries. ISIL is widely known for its videos of beheadings and other types of executions[83] of both soldiers and civilians, including journalists and aid workers, and its destruction of cultural heritage sites.[84] The United Nations holds ISIL responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes. ISIL also committed ethnic cleansing on an historic scale in northern Iraq.[85] </p>
   "ISIS is not a Humanitarian organization which can not save people" is nonsense.

   Kim Jong-un does a much better job than Bill Clinton.
   Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims who he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history.
   Though Hitler killed thousands of people, some german regard him as a hero. </p>
